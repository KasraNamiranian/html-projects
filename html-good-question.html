<!-- This is a good question. In html we must make uniq ids. when we don't make ids uniq it doesn't give us error but it's not correct.
 In this question it makes both paragraphs red but it's not correct.-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <style>
        #title {
            color: red;
        }

    <p id="title">Hi I'm a Title with an ID</p>
